/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 *
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, ensuring that only the authenticated user can access their own data.
 *   All data is nested under `/users/{userId}`, and subcollections inherit this ownership. This eliminates the need for `get()` calls in security rules, crucial for maintaining atomic operations and debuggability.
 *
 * @dataStructure
 *   - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles. Only the user can read/write their own profile.
 *   - /users/{userId}/interviewSessions/{interviewSessionId}: Stores interview sessions for each user. Only the user can read/write their own sessions.
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 *   - User listing is disallowed to protect privacy.
 *   - All write operations are restricted to the owner of the data, enforced through path-based ownership.
 *   - Data validation is minimal to allow for rapid prototyping and schema evolution.  Only authorization-critical fields are validated.
 *
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization
 *   - The `userId` is present in the path for all subcollections, enabling simple `isOwner(userId)` checks without needing to read the document.
